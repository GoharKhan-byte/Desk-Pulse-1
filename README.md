🎥 DeskPulse

Real-time office presence and idle-time analytics, running on a plain CPU.

DeskPulse detects people from a webcam, external camera, or video file, tracks each one with a persistent ID, and flags anyone who stays stationary beyond a configurable threshold. Inference runs on an OpenVINO-exported YOLO model, so no GPU is required.

✨ Features
YOLO + ByteTrack multi-object tracking with persistent IDs
Intel OpenVINO acceleration for real-time CPU inference
Idle detection based on movement tolerance and a configurable timeout
Live Streamlit dashboard with active tracks, idle count, FPS, and a violations table
Threaded camera capture with a minimal buffer for low latency
Frame-skip control to trade inference frequency for smoother video
Alerts with per-track cooldown: audible beep plus CSV and SQLite logging
Flexible input: built-in webcam, external camera index, or video file

               Annotated live feed     Telemetry + table      Alerts (beep, CSV, SQLite)
Each frame is read by a background thread so the UI never blocks on the camera.
Every Nth frame (configurable), the model detects and tracks people.
For each track, the centroid is compared with its last stored position.
If movement stays under Movement Tolerance for longer than Idle Timeout, the track is marked idle.
Idle events trigger an alert, rate-limited per track by the Alert Cooldown.
Movement resets the idle timer and the alert cooldown.
📦 Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/GoharKhan-byte/Desk-Pulse.git
cd Desk-Pulse

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS

pip install -r requirements.txt

The camera code uses cv2.CAP_DSHOW, so it is tuned for Windows. On Linux/macOS, adjust or remove that flag in ThreadedCamera.

🚀 Usage
1. Export your model to OpenVINO

Place your trained weights (best.pt) in the project root and run:

bash
python export_model.py

This creates the best_openvino_model/ folder that the app loads. (Under the hood this is YOLO("best.pt").export(format="openvino").)

2. Run the dashboard
bash
streamlit run app.py

Then tick Start Live Stream in the sidebar.

⚙️ Configuration

All settings are live-tunable from the sidebar.

Setting	Description	Default
Target Classes	Which classes to detect and track	All
Confidence Threshold	Minimum detection confidence	0.45
Movement Tolerance (px)	Max centroid shift still counted as stationary	35
Idle Timeout (s)	Stationary time before a track is flagged idle	10
Inference Frame Skip	Run the model every Nth frame	2
Alert Cooldown (s)	Min time between repeat alerts for the same track	10
Video Source	Webcam, external camera index, or video file	Webcam

🗂️ Logged Data

Idle events are written to idle_violations.csv and floorpulse.db, so you can analyze them later with pandas, SQL, or a BI tool. Set sqlite_path=None in load_alert_manager() to log CSV only.

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Problem	Fix
"Unable to open camera stream"	Close Teams/Zoom/Camera app and check Windows camera privacy settings
"OpenVINO model directory not found"	Run the export step above
Low FPS	Increase frame skip, lower the confidence threshold, or reduce imgsz
missing ScriptRunContext warning	Launch with streamlit run app.py, not python app.py
🔒 Privacy & Responsible Use

DeskPulse is designed as occupancy and activity analytics, not individual surveillance.

Processing runs locally; no video is uploaded anywhere
No face recognition or identity tracking, only anonymous track IDs
Obtain consent and follow local workplace and data-protection laws before deploying
Be transparent with the people being monitored about what is measured and why
🗺️ Roadmap
 Dashboard page for historical idle analytics from SQLite
 Zone-based monitoring (per desk or area)
 RTSP / IP camera support
 Docker image
 Configurable working-hours schedule
